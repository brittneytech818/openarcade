- Controller costs too much gas to deploy
  - Move some code to library
  - Make RNG optional
  - Move some RNG code to library
- Games should request random before using rng.next
  - Otherwise players know what the next numebrs are and can cheat
  - Some kind of async/await programming is needed in the games
    - Game requests RNG update, awaits it
    - RNG gets updated by player
    - Game gets the RNG
- Controller timeouts
  - [x] Player should lose if misses his/her turn
  - [x] Should work with fastforward and other state channel stuff
  - [x] Timeout during Playing state (S1+)
    - If RNG is ready (Sx-1), should punish control player
    - If RNG not ready (Sx-0), should punish ring turn player
  - [x] Timeout during Depositing state
    - Can simply refund everyone and end the game
  - [x] Timeout during Starting state (S0)
    - [x] In this state the players set up RNG then anyone calls init
