- Commit-reveal RNG
  - Add lock time
  - Add timeout
- Controller costs too much gas to deploy
  - Move some code to library
  - Make RNG optional
  - Move some RNG code to library
- Staged commit-reveal
  - Every time player sends to `play` player makes a commit and reveals the previous commit
  - Interleaved commit-reveal
    - One player commit-reveal per round, updates the RNG seed
    - Game calls `rng.refresh()` to request seed update
- Init parameters
  - Passing some optional init params into game lib's `init`
- Games should request random before using next
  - Otherwise players know what the next numebrs are and can cheat
  - Some kind of async/await programming is needed in the games
    - Game requests RNG update, awaits it
    - RNG gets updated by player
    - Game gets the RNG
- Maybe split this meta repo into different packages. Need to update those packages when project is done. Also maybe change project's dependencies to just use those.
  - solidity-bytesutil
  - eth-xrandom
